# PapyrusUtil SE

This is the SE version of the source code.

Depends on Boost, Jsoncpp, and the latest version of SKSE64.

Note: I'm not a C++ programmer. This was mainly all written after Googling basics and then applying the results here as necessary.
I also haven't very reliably kept up my local repo of it for the past 6-ish years. This was basically just a quick open source where I added every file I thought maybe relevant to the repo and pushed it. There is almost certainly old and unused files here. Sorry.

Will try to clean this up and push a LE branch later(tm).
