# PapyrusUtil SE

This is the SE version of the source code.

Depends on Boost and Jsoncpp.

Note: I'm not a C++ programmer. This was mainly all written after Googling basics and then applying the results here.
I also haven't very reliably kept up my local repo of it for the past 6 years. This was basically just a quick open source where I added every file I thought maybe relevant to the repo and pushed it. There is almost certainly old or unused files here. Sorry.

Will try to clean this up and push a LE branch later.
